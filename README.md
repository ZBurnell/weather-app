# Weather Dashboard / Not The Weather Channel

# Description
Weather dashboard that allows a user to search for a city and get current weather information. The webpage utilizes local storage to save the users input. Allowin the user to select a previous city quicker when compared to typing the location again. There are a few safeties in place that will generate an error message if the user inputs a city that is not recognized by the openweathermap API.

# Installation

# Acknowledgment
